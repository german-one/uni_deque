C Deque Library

Implementation of a deque using a doubly-linked list as container.

Besides of the general functions which can be used for any kind of data, the library contains functions that are already specialized for basic types and string types.

This library also allows you to insert and access values at any position in the list, to enumerate a range of the list, to reverse the list, to sort the list, to insert sorted, to search for values, ...

The comments in the first 250 lines of "uni_deque.h" should give you all the information you need to work with the library.
The "main.c" file contains two examples of how to use the library. One for int values and one for null-terminated strings.
